# HistoryQuiz

I made this history quiz to use OOP with python. The way that I did this was by creating a question class and then creating objects from that class to be called upon. I changed the attributes of the objects so that they would match what was needed for each question. I used the time function to give a little bit of time in between each question and also the beginning and end of the quiz.
